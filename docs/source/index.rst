EthicalGardeners documentation
==============================

**EthicalGardeners** is a `PettingZoo`_ multi-agent environment for simulating
gardeners tending to a grid-world garden, including ethical considerations.

The goal is to make agents learn an ethically-aligned behaviour that includes
and respects these considerations.

This project is under construction!
