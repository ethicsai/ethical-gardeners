"""
The WorldGrid module represents the physical environment simulation grid for
Ethical Gardeners.

This module defines the fundamental structures of the simulated environment
where agents (gardeners) interact with the world. The environment consists of:

1. A 2D grid of cells (:py:class:`Cell`) - Each cell represents a physical
location that can be of different types (:py:class:`CellType`). The cells
have a pollution level that evolves over time, depending on whether they
contain flowers or not.

2. Flowers (:py:class:`Flower`) - Plants that agents can grow in ground cells:

* Different types with unique growth patterns and properties
* Progress through growth stages over time
* Reduce pollution in their cell based on type and growth stage
* Can be harvested for monetary value when fully grown
* Return seeds when harvested that can be used to plant more flowers

3. Agents (:py:class:`.Agent`) - Gardeners that move through and interact with
the environment:

* Can move between cells
* Plant flowers using seeds from their inventory
* Harvest fully grown flowers for monetary value

The WorldGrid provides methods to initialize the environment (from file,
randomly, or programmatically), place and manage agents and flowers,
update environmental conditions, and validate agent actions.

    Represents the physical grid world environment for the Ethical Gardeners

    The WorldGrid manages a 2D grid of cells. It handles the flowers and agents
    and manages their placement within the environment. The grid can be
    initialized from a file, randomly generated, or manually configured.

    Attributes:
        width (int): The width of the grid in cells.
        height (int): The height of the grid in cells.
        min_pollution (float): The minimum level of pollution a cell can have
            at any time. The cell pollution decreases over time when flowers
            are planted, but cannot go lower than this minimum value.
        max_pollution (float): The maximum level of pollution a cell can have
            at any time. The cell pollution increases over time when no flowers
            are planted, but cannot go higher than this maximum value.
        pollution_increment (float): Amount by which pollution increases in
            empty cells.

            simultaneously.
        grid (list): 2D array of Cell objects representing the environment.
        agents (list): List of all Agent objects in the environment.
