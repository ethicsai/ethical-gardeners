# EthicalGardeners

**EthicalGardeners** is a [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/)
multi-agent environment for simulating gardeners tending to a grid-world
garden, including ethical considerations.

The goal is to make agents learn an ethically-aligned behaviour that includes
and respects these considerations.
